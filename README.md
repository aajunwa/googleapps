Google Apps Marketability Factors

A lot of applications are frequently created and hosted on Google Play Store. However, not many of these get downloaded as much as expected. 

The problem is to predict the marketablity (number of downloads) of an android mobile application by variables such as minimum required android version, price, size, and ratings, as well as any other significantly impacting variables.

It is believed that an understanding of the significant factors that can influence the marketablity of a mobile application, would aid designers and developers in making informed decisions during implementation and deployment of such applications.
