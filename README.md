# googleapps
A lot of applications are frequently created and hosted on Google Play Store. However, not many of these get downloaded as much as expected. This project attemps to predict the downloadability (dependent variable) of an android mobile application by independent variables such as minimum required android version, price, size, and ratings. it is believed that an understanding of the significant factors that can influence the downloadability of an application, would aid designers and developers in making informed decisions during implementation and deployment of marketable applications. Data is to be collected from the Kaggle's Google Play Store Apps dataset https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps
